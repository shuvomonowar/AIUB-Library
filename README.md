This is my ambitious project for the Advanced Programming with Java course: a web-based library management system (Stack: Apache Maven, Spring MVC, MySQL). I am disappointed that I could not complete the project within the semester time constraints, but I am determined to revisit it in the near future. My goal is to refine and perfect the system, making it more responsive and user-friendly.
The library management system is designed to streamline the process of managing books, users, and borrowing activities. It aims to provide a seamless experience for both librarians and library patrons. Through this project, I have gained valuable insights into Java programming, web development, and database management. These skills will undoubtedly aid me in further enhancing the system's functionality and design.
